```scala
import org.virtuslab.genesis.Genesis

val settings = yourSettings ++ Genesis.common
```

Test
----

Generates JUnit XML test reports, usefull if your CI needs them. Code copied from [junit_xml_listener](https://github.com/hydrasi/junit_xml_listener) via Play! framework.

```scala
import org.virtuslab.genesis

val settings = yourSettings ++ genesis.test.JUnitReports.settings
```

Lift logger initializer
-----------------------

Lift have issues with initializing logger in tests, to overcome them you can use `LoggerInitializer`.

*WARNING* - this will blow up if you include it and do not have Lift on classpath.

```scala
import org.virtuslab.genesis

val settings = yourSettings ++ genesis.lift.LoggerInitializer.settings
```
